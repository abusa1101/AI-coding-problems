# AI-coding-problems

Solutions to a series of fun AI problems in Python!

Project0: 
(1) Cellular Automaton implementation, 
(2) Array Sorting, (3) Graph Construction

Project1: 
(1) Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening, Uniform Cost, A*), 
(2) Route Planning using Search Algorithms, 
(3) Travelling Salesman Problem using Search algorithms 

Project2: 
(1) Tic-Tac-Toe Solver using MINIMAX-DECISION algorithm (Input/Output through .txt files);
